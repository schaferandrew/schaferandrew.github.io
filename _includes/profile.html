        <p>
          I’m a software developer with 6 years of industry experience. While tech and roles have varied, one thing has been consistent: I thrive delivering consumer first, digital products.  Recently, I’ve been obsessed with NextJS and React, as well as custom themes for WordPress using PHP and Advanced Custom Fields.

          When I’m not crushing user stories,  I can be found behind a camera wherever I found a cheap plane ticket, volunteering on my local Parks + Placemaking committee board, or trying to read too many books at once.
