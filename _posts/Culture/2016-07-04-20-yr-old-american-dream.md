title: A 20 Year Old's Perception of the American Dream
---

Today is America’s Independence day and there is no better day to talk about what’s been on my mind. Americans hold many values close to there hearts. (if you see “there” you’ll notice that grammar isn’t one of those things). Freedom, helping out hose in need (even if they don’t ask), equality, and star of today’s musings, the pursuit of the “American Dream”. As a kid, I saw this as a very simple goal: Have the ability to afford a cottage. (Cabin, lake house, whatever you prefer.) My favorite memories growing up are rooted in this dream that my parents were fortunate enough to realize. At the core of all these memories lies family, adventure, friends, an escape from day to day, and of course; food and water. By water, I’m not referring to the type that you drink, I'm talking about the kind you swim and boat in. As I've grown older and have had the luxury of more experience, my mentality has changed. To me, work is simply a means to an end. I find ways to thoroughly enjoy the time I get paid for, but works is not my reason for existing. To me, my goals is to experience as much as I possibly can with my life. I want to be able to explore; every weekend, every year. This means I need to be able to "check out" of work and just live. I see others that place money as the foundation of success because it allows them to have an escape in the form of a cottage or take lavish vacations. Then I see people like Hoot, my rafting guide this weekend.

He loves everyday. He doesn't make a lot of money but he explores, has fun, and stays active every moment of his life. The American dream isn't universal, just like success isn't. To me, that's the beauty of it, and honestly, it's what it means to be an American: The opportunity to find a unique happiness.
