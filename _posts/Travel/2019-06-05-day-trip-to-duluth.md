Sometimes, you really only need a day.

The first thing to understand, or remember if you know me, is that I’m from Michigan.  So recently in fact, I haven’t gotten a Minnesota license yet. One of my core beliefs, which especially applies when you are in a new place, is that people underestimate the possibilities of a day. It's so common where people pass on weekend trips because they have one single thing already planned. This hurts me to my very core.

Fortunately, I didn't do that and instead, said yes to plans, to doing something, and went North.

I trust I don't have to spend too much time on the drive; good tunes, chill vibes, and deep(ish) convos.

## Stop 1: Jay Cooke State Park

This was the perfect way to break up to the drive. Beautifall falls and and bridges are right next to the parking lot and the rocks are open to climb around to explore the area. We took the Silver Creek Trail. When it followed the river it exposed many beautiful views, but in the interior wasn't a must see and resulted in a tick encounter. Overall, the river kept the temperatures pleasant, the rocks formations were beautiful and allowed for some great exploration, and we skipped a few stones.

See the photo locations above? It resulted in these:

## Stop 2: Duluth

The hike was followed with a refreshing beer on the shores of Lake Superior in Duluth. Canal Park Brewery was amazing as always and we spent some time splashing around with a puppy named Oakley. See below for "awww".

## Stop 3: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

The day was wrapped watching the sunset at a spot, it's secret so no pics, somewhere along the North Shore. It was nice. 

Weekends, well days for that matter, really shouldn't be underestimated. If you're not careful, you can make them pretty fun.
