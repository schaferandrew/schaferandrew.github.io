While the frameworks I use, the industries I support, and even role descriptions have varied, one thing has been consistent: I thrive delivering consumer-first digital products. I love starting with a user problem, then finding the best way to solve that through technology. Recently, I’ve been working with NextJS and React, as well as custom themes for WordPress using PHP and Advanced Custom Fields. My priorities in the work I deliver are fast, maintainable, modern, accessible, and fun. This is done through good design, smart development patterns, and as much as I don’t love this word: _strict_ scss standards. I will always push for the right tooling for the job to ensure we don’t overbuild, while leaving headroom for growth. I strive for an end result that is a beautiful, user friendly platform to engage with your community in new, thoughtful ways. When I’m not crushing user stories,  I can be found behind a camera wherever I found a cheap plane ticket, volunteering on my local Parks + Placemaking committee board, or trying to read too many books at once.</subtitle><entry><title type="html">Building Next Generation Brand Sites</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/technology/2022/03/25/building-next-generation-brand-sites.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Building Next Generation Brand Sites" /><published>2022-03-25T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2022-03-25T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/technology/2022/03/25/building-next-generation-brand-sites</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/technology/2022/03/25/building-next-generation-brand-sites.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/technology/2022/next/brands.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Logos of General Mills Brands like Cheerios and Annies&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;overview&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a developer for the Branded Sites team at General Mills, we build and maintain brand sites for hundreds of brands in our portfolio. Each site has different goals, brand managers, and budgets. We needed a product that we could offer that is modern, fast, reliable, easy to work on and maintain, and delivers a great user experience for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-components-i-delivered&quot;&gt;Key Components I Delivered&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rating and Review Client-Side Component&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Server Side API Routes to Submit Ratings&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Detached Wordpress CMS Setup&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bazaar Voice Integration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;technology-used&quot;&gt;Technology Used&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;NextJS&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;React&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;GraphQL&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Webpack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;link&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cinnamontoastcrunch.com/&quot;&gt;Visit Site →&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;table-of-contents&quot;&gt;Table of Contents&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#why-a-headless-front-end&quot;&gt;Why a Headless Front-End?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#why-nextjs&quot;&gt;Why NextJS?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#my-role-on-the-team&quot;&gt;My Role&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#accessibility&quot;&gt;Accessibility&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#outcome&quot;&gt;Outcome&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-a-headless-front-end&quot;&gt;Why a Headless Front-End?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General Mills has a large portfolio of different brands in different regions around the world. As a result, each branch varies in its needs and budget. This means the content that appears on the site ranges from a simple static entry in CMS like WordPress, or advanced profile and product data that comes from internal APIs. There is also the benefit of not being tied to a specific CMS provider. For example, sites at General Mills use Sitecore, this is a paid service and if you are using their base framework, your site is tied to that contract and will not work without it. With a headless solution, you could migrate the CMS data and keep the front end work with the same functionality. It gives us flexibility in pricing and contracts to ensure we can make the best decision as new opportunities come up as we won’t be locked to past decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-did-we-pick-this-framework&quot;&gt;Why did We Pick this Framework?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/technology/2022/next/logo.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Next JS Logo&quot; /&gt;
Next allows us to pull data from all the different sources in the best possible rendering method as we can do it at build time for static data, server-side for api requests, or even client site to integrate with our vendors. The team was also familiar with React as we have done &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatsbyjs.com/&quot;&gt;Gatsby&lt;/a&gt; projects in the past. React doesn’t seem to be losing momentum anytime soon as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-role-on-the-team&quot;&gt;My Role on the Team&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My official title on this team was &lt;em&gt;Advanced Developer&lt;/em&gt;, otherwise known as &lt;em&gt;Engineer 2&lt;/em&gt; across the industry. A unique advantage I had is that I came from an analyst background and have experience leading projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;project-management&quot;&gt;Project Management&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically for the Rating and Review feature, I lead a team of designers and producers, as well as the relationship with our vender for syndicating reviews to our partner, [Bazaar Voice]. I created our JIRA board, development process, wrote the bulk of our user stories as well as led all UAT (user acceptance testing) and design reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;design&quot;&gt;Design&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Design has always been a passion of mine, including taking every art class my schedule allowed when studying computer science and I enjoyed being part of the design process for this component. This was highly beneficial for the ratings and review project. I worked collaboratively with the designers on our, gave feedback on the design standards, and ultimately guided the handoff process that allowed me to hit the ground running when stories were ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;development&quot;&gt;Development&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I built it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously there’s a bit more to this but I did the discovery for the service we were consuming, wrote our server side api routes, and build the front end components to allow for Ratings and reviews. I also contributed to our product base by setting up the headless CMS standard and installing the GraphQL plugins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;accessibility&quot;&gt;Accessibility&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;general-approach&quot;&gt;General Approach&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important. Everyone deserves the ability to navigate the fruits, and yes, even the toxicity of internet. At General Mills, we were fortunate enough to work with a tremendous accessibility partner, WeCo. Members of that team would navigate through the products that we build and allowed us to view how users navigated the site when using tools like screen readers. Seeing this in person allowed us to make the best product possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;read-more--read-less&quot;&gt;Read More / Read Less&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/technology/2022/next/read-more.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Read More / Read Less User Folow&quot; /&gt;
A surprisingly hard feature to get right is Read More / Read Less. Getting the user to not lose context when expanding the paragraph to review is tricky. I had to trap focus and move the user to the review title that I gave a tab index. There’s still some repeat material but the user isn’t lost or sent to the top of the page. The best recommendation here is to only use it in extreme cases!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;screen-takeovers&quot;&gt;Screen Takeovers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For writing a review, the design consisted of a full screen takeover so the experience is clean and not distracting. The key learning here to to trap the users’ focus and not allow them to tab out of the input elements to elements that are hidden by the takeover. I also used a plugin that disables scroll behind the takeover so the user isn’t lost when the takeover closes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;outcome&quot;&gt;Outcome&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our team delivered the solution months ahead of time and migrated 7 sites onto this new platform. Product nutrition and ingredient information has been more reliable since it doesn’t have to be manually updated, we simply get the current version from our product service. Ratings and Reviews has also been implemented, allowing us to build community with our users. The component that we build for it far exceeds the accessibility standards of out of the box options.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="technology" /><summary type="html">Overview As a developer for the Branded Sites team at General Mills, we build and maintain brand sites for hundreds of brands in our portfolio.

&lt;p&gt;Haagen Dazs has franchise owners around the world. They need a single source of truth for all the information that they need when learning about the opportunity. If it’s the right fit, I also build the application form within this solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;server-side-routing-in-wordpress&quot;&gt;Server Side Routing in Wordpress&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to handle the submit by routing through admin.post. This is done in the functions.php.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-php&quot; data-lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cd&quot;&gt;/**
  * Adds function for handling application form procession. Uses admin-post.php.
  * NOTE: Can also require another file that would have all of the logic
  */&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;send_application_form_to_server&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
 	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;get_template_directory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'/inc/form-processor.php'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

 &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;add_action&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'admin_post_nopriv_application_form'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'send_application_form_to_server'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;add_action&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'admin_post_application_form'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'send_application_form_to_server'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above code now requires the form processor that I created. This processed the post req and handles different options like redirecting, showing errors, or handling invalid posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-php&quot; data-lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;foreach&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$_POST&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$key&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
 		&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;in_array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$acceptedInputs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
 			&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$formInputs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$key&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;clean_input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

 		&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
 	&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This all matched the variables that salesforce required in their dashboard. Of course we needed API Keys and urls but you don’t need that here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;error-handling&quot;&gt;Error Handling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Error Handling takes place at three different points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When you leave an input by hitting &lt;em&gt;tab&lt;/em&gt; or clicking away&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Client Side Checking after clicking &lt;em&gt;submit&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Responding to the API Errors after submission
The &lt;a href=&quot;https://oliverjam.es/blog/better-native-form-validation/&quot;&gt;Better Native Form Validation&lt;/a&gt; article by Oliver Jam was very helpful in getting started with native validation. From here, it’s just reacting to the states and updating the error messages within each input group.

&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;design&quot;&gt;Design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/technology/2021/wordpress/design.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Examples of the same components with different styles&quot; /&gt;
The custom design called for different components with special colors and styles depending on the purpose of that section. I built components with the ability to flexible and allowed them to seamlessly blend in with each other. The purpose of this was to clearly separate what we wanted the user to get out of each section. For example: The application section was blue and support was Orange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;recaptcha&quot;&gt;ReCaptcha&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create the most accessible experience possible, I implemented &lt;a href=&quot;[https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/v3&quot;&gt;ReCaptcha Version 3&lt;/a&gt;. This version doesn’t require the annoying robot tests that are often difficult for screen reader users. This is also a better experience for everyone and is a lot quicker. It creates a score based on your behavior behind the scenes. It’s a little creepy, but it’s pretty effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;outcome&quot;&gt;Outcome&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leads from direct applications went up infinitely! That’s mainly because before this, it simply didn’t exist. Potential franchisees had to resort to word of mouth or hope to get called by the right person. It also was a great test case for forms within WordPress and our team grew in capabilities that we could offer other brands. Lastly, the custom design challenge was just fun and I think it looks pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="technology" /><summary type="html">Overview Haagen Dazs has franchise owners around the world.

&lt;p&gt;The most common question you endure when you land after a spell of air travel is, “How was the flight”. 99% of the time, “It was fine” pretty much sums it up and it is always met with glowing approvals and anecdotes to past travel horror stories. The flight sticks in people’s mind longer than the sandwich they ordered for lunch in San Francisco or the cute Airbnb in the Poconos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I truly don’t understand the fascination and concern that’s applied to the logistics of air travel. Next time your in security look around and observe. Nobody can handle it. People lose their minds in worry and the simple truth is that just about everything is completely out of their control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way I see it, the flight is simply the vessel to get to the adventure. I try not to get hung up in worrying about lost bags, layovers, etc. Life is just easier when you just go with the flow and ride out delays, pack light with carry on only, and try to enjoy the commute with a movie or good book. You’ll get there right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This theory was tested lasted weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I flew to Denver. For one day. I was supposed to anyway. Below is a picture of my friends and I on Day 1 of 1. I don’t have a picture of us on Day 2 of 1 but if I did, we wouldn’t have been looking our best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/travel/2019/06-08-denver-day-trip_1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Andrew and his friend in front of a wall mural at Denver Brewing Co.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need to start at the beginning. This was the weekend for the inaugural event we proudly dubbed, “Microtravel”. The brilliant plan was to find bonkers cheap flights that left early in the morning and returned late that night. It would allow for no luggage and promised a light weight, adventurous day in a new city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All things considered, that’s exactly what it did. We arrived on time and instantly filled our day with a brewery tour of Coors and Blue Moon, some good food, and old fashioned exploring. We had great weather, good company, and I’m always a sucker for checking out new places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, it went so well that when we got the notification that the flight was delayed for an hour, we cheered. “One more drink!” We had exclaimed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We did get that drink, but the cheering slowly diminished as the departure kept getting pushed back. We witnessed an arrest in the terminal, boarded and deplaned, and waited some more. Frontier forgot to book a pilot. Totally understandable, who would have thought that would be an important part of our aeronautical journey. Frontier, silly silly airline. This lead to a cancellation with no flights until Monday, which even if that was an option, was selling for a cool $400 per seat. Oh, there also wasn’t enough seats for all of us. That lead to the only option left, renting a car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those without quick access to google maps, which is crazy because this is an online blog, Denver to Minneapolis is about 14 hours. With an ideal start time of 3:30 am following a day of brewery hopping that started at 4:00 am, I can’t think of a better road trip recipe. Oh, and the bulk of the drive was through Nebraska and Iowa. Picturesque.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, we packed light, and by light I mean absolutely nothing as the itinerary stopped at “hour 10 in Denver”. I have never been more exhausted, most likely stinky, and tired of farm fields in recent (let’s be honest, distant) memory. But we did it, we made it. That’s a bond that’s hard to break when you endure that type of experience. Am I gearing up for another road trip with those parameters. No. No. Not even a little. However, what a weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out the travel in “travel” really does leave a lasting impression, and is something worth being added to the story. In 10 years I might not remember the name of the beer I had a Blue Moon Brewery (Mango Wheat btw), but I will certainly remember the 14 hour road trip that was kicked off at the optimal time of 3:30 in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="travel" /><summary type="html">Frontier ruined my Trip … Wait, Did They?</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">A Perfect Day Trip to Duluth</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/travel/2019/06/05/day-trip-to-duluth.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="A Perfect Day Trip to Duluth" /><published>2019-06-05T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-06-05T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/travel/2019/06/05/day-trip-to-duluth</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/travel/2019/06/05/day-trip-to-duluth.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/travel/2019/06-05-duluth-day-trip.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Picture of Andrew and Jess standing on rocks in Lake Superior&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, you really only need a day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing to understand, or remember if you know me, is that I’m from Michigan.  So recently in fact, I haven’t gotten a Minnesota license yet. One of my core beliefs, which especially applies when you are in a new place, is that people underestimate the possibilities of a day. It’s so common where people pass on weekend trips because they have one single thing already planned. This hurts me to my very core.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, I didn’t do that and instead, said yes to plans, to doing something, and went North.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I trust I don’t have to spend too much time on the drive; good tunes, chill vibes, and deep(ish) convos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;stop-1-jay-cooke-state-park&quot;&gt;Stop 1: Jay Cooke State Park&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/travel/2019/06-06-cooke-map.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Map of Jay Cooke State Park&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the perfect way to break up to the drive. Beautifall falls and and bridges are right next to the parking lot and the rocks are open to climb around to explore the area. We took the Silver Creek Trail. When it followed the river it exposed many beautiful views, but in the interior wasn’t a must see and resulted in a tick encounter. Overall, the river kept the temperatures pleasant, the rocks formations were beautiful and allowed for some great exploration, and we skipped a few stones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See the photo locations above? It resulted in these:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/travel/2019/06-05-duluth-day-trip_1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bridge of Rapids at Jay Cooke State Park&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/travel/2019/06-05-duluth-day-trip_2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Jess in the Falls&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;stop-2-duluth&quot;&gt;Stop 2: Duluth&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hike was followed with a refreshing beer on the shores of Lake Superior in Duluth. Canal Park Brewery was amazing as always and we spent some time splashing around with a puppy named Oakley. See below for “awww”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/travel/2019/06-05-duluth-day-trip_3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Golden Retriever splashing in Lake Superior&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;stop-3-_ツ_&quot;&gt;Stop 3: ¯_(ツ)_/¯&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day was wrapped watching the sunset at a spot, it’s secret so no pics, somewhere along the North Shore. It was nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weekends, well days for that matter, really shouldn’t be underestimated. If you’re not careful, you can make them pretty fun.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="travel" /><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Welcome to Jekyll!</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2019/05/25/welcome-to-jekyll.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Welcome to Jekyll!" /><published>2019-05-25T16:33:39-04:00</published><updated>2019-05-25T16:33:39-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2019/05/25/welcome-to-jekyll</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2019/05/25/welcome-to-jekyll.html">&lt;p&gt;You’ll find this post in your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory.

&lt;p&gt;The hardest part of writing this website, believe it or not, was to get started. There are so many options for hosting, content management, and languages. It absolutely can be overwhelming. In the journey of building this, I started with Jekyll two years ago. It went terribly. I got caught up in trying to find the best theme and spent to much effort fighting themes instead of understanding the platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My career progressed into a role where I was working with a Sitecore implementation. In my undergrad, we didn’t touch on CMS (content management systems) and it felt unnecessary. Why not just build a backend and link to your own database? Why be stuck to certain rules and pay someone a lot of money for that pleasure? Eventually it became clear that it was all about scale. There isn’t a reason to have a developer code every page that is a little big custom. Having a separate authoring team does have extremely valuable cost savings. In my discovery period in getting familiar with the platform, I build out a proof of concept in Wordpress. Honestly it was fun. I saw how customizable it could be. The benefits of allowing guests to contribute, the thorough documentation,and it was a good skill to add to my quiver. However, it had one major downside: A cost to host.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t see this website as a vehicle for earning substantial income and it didn’t seem to make sense to pay a monthly fee for a portfolio site when there were other options to host it for free. Looking on the site now, maybe there is opportunity for a wider audience to my content, by that certainly wasn’t the driving force for this project. What wordpress did really well was help me understand the concepts of a CMS, or in Jekyll’s case, a static site generator. Now that I understood the underlying development pattern, I went back to the documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, the documentation on the site is incredibly well maintained and easy to follow. I recommend starting here with their &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/&quot;&gt;step by step guide.&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It guides you everywhere from setting up ruby and jekyll on your machine to building a base project. Another good resource I found was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1itpPvFWHI&quot;&gt;Mike Dane&lt;/a&gt;. His tuturials really helped with my grasp of the basics and using Liquid. Liquid is the programming language you can use within your markup to pull in data from the site. From there I was able to write custom code that could pull select categories. This allowed me to solve the issue wanting more than one type of posts for images, videos, etc. Below is an example of how to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Place your category or categories in the front matter:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-markdown&quot; data-lang=&quot;markdown&quot;&gt;layout: post
categories: technology
title: How I built my website with Jekyll (For Free)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then created a collection layout that would pull in the correct category from the page (using front matter) and compare it with the post category from above:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt;{% if site.posts.size &amp;gt; 0 %}
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    {% for post in site.posts%}
    {% if post.categories contains page.categories%}
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;li&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;post-item&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        {%- assign date_format = site.minima.date_format | default: &quot;%b %-d, %Y&quot; -%}
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;span&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;post-meta&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;{{ post.date | date: date_format }}&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;post-link&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;{{ post.url | relative_url }}&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                {{ post.title | escape }}
            &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        {%- if site.show_excerpts -%}
            &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;{{ post.excerpt | strip_html | truncatewords:50 }}&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        {%- endif -%}
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    {%endif%}
    {%endfor%}
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
{% endif %}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best part about this besides being able to fit my needs, is the integration with github pages. I can host the site absolutely free and can easily push up changes and add posts.

I’m worried for my generation, and not in the way you might think. Every ad, every speech, movie, and novel geared towards our generation creates a fantasy that we need to do what we love. And get paid for it.
Well, I don’t. Not exactly anyway. Don’t get me wrong, I followed a major that I was interested and have a decent job. Working on a project that isn’t bland, yet it isn’t writing, or photography, or art, or app design. I’m getting paid to do something because not everyone can and wants to do it.
That was a sucky realization. At first anyway. The truth is that not everyone can be a writer, AND be paid for it. My generation, and myself specifically, believe that if I’m not doing exactly what I love and am being paid then I’m failing myself.
Here’s my conclusion. I will have to work a job where I might not love everything that I do. But I can still do what I love to do, in whatever form that takes. And I won’t get paid for it at first, but I’m also not good. I need to get better, and never stop. That’s how I can do what I love, and maybe someday, only do that.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="culture" /><summary type="html">I’m worried for my generation, and not in the way you might think.

That’s how I can do what I love, and maybe someday, only do that.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Two Halves</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/culture/2017/08/07/two-halves.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Two Halves" /><published>2017-08-07T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2017-08-07T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/culture/2017/08/07/two-halves</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/culture/2017/08/07/two-halves.html">&lt;p&gt;I used to think there isn’t any possible way that my hobbies and career choice could be more different. If I’m not in front of a computer muscling through debugs, I’m most likely halfway up a mountain somewhere pretty far from home. Even the word “home” has a loose interpretation when I examine my own life. I’ve lived throughout the beautiful State of Michigan (a proud Spartan I might add), Louisville Kentucky, and most recently, Minneapolis Minnesota. Through many adventures, jobs, and dwellings, I’ve always searched for what I was truly passionate about. While the activities have taken many shapes, they all have same outcome, wonder. Wonder is the first time you saw a touch screen phone. Wonder is jumping out of an airplane and seeing the curvature of the Earth, watching Mr. Fredricksen float his house in the clouds, hiking the Adirondack Mountains and Wonder is the lens in which I view the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every project I’ve taken part of on this portfolio is in pursuit of evoking wonder or simply capturing it. To me, to be human is to wonder, to be curious and retrospective. It excites me how technology can make lives easier, more connected, and overall better with creative thinking and a few lines of code. Adventures down rivers, up mountains and through trails are great because of the people that I’ve shared that emotion and story with. In short, I’m a storyteller, photographer, designer, and developer chasing wonder.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="culture" /><summary type="html">I used to think there isn’t any possible way that my hobbies and career choice could be more different.

Americans hold many values close to there hearts. (if you see “there” you’ll notice that grammar isn’t one of those things). Freedom, helping out hose in need (even if they don’t ask), equality, and star of today’s musings, the pursuit of the “American Dream”. As a kid, I saw this as a very simple goal: Have the ability to afford a cottage. (Cabin, lake house, whatever you prefer.) My favorite memories growing up are rooted in this dream that my parents were fortunate enough to realize. At the core of all these memories lies family, adventure, friends, an escape from day to day, and of course; food and water. By water, I’m not referring to the type that you drink, I’m talking about the kind you swim and boat in. As I’ve grown older and have had the luxury of more experience, my mentality has changed. To me, work is simply a means to an end. I find ways to thoroughly enjoy the time I get paid for, but works is not my reason for existing. To me, my goals is to experience as much as I possibly can with my life. I want to be able to explore; every weekend, every year. This means I need to be able to “check out” of work and just live. I see others that place money as the foundation of success because it allows them to have an escape in the form of a cottage or take lavish vacations. Then I see people like Hoot, my rafting guide this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He loves everyday. He doesn’t make a lot of money but he explores, has fun, and stays active every moment of his life. The American dream isn’t universal, just like success isn’t. To me, that’s the beauty of it, and honestly, it’s what it means to be an American: The opportunity to find a unique happiness.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="culture" /><summary type="html">Today is America’s Independence day and there is no better day to talk about what’s been on my mind.
